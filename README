Django app for validating a credit card number built with Docker.

To install, run `docker-compose build`.

To start app, run `docker-compose up`.

The service has only one endpoint and one HTTP method: GET localhost:8000/card-validation

It can be accessed in the following ways:

localhost:8000/card-validation/<card-number>
localhost:8000/card-validation/?ccn=<card-number>
localhost:8000/card-validation?ccn=<card-number>

<card-number> is a numerical string only; including any other type of character will result in the following response:

{
    is_valid: false,
    mii: null,
    mii_details: null,
    iin: null,
    scheme: null,
    account_number: null,
    checknum: null
}

Not including a ccn as part of the path or as a query string paramter will result in a 400 error with the message:
"You must include a credit card number."

As a small bit of security I updated settings to not log any credit card numbers so there would be no physical record of potentially sensitive data. I added logging indicating if a valid or invalid credit card number was submitted. These could be used for temporary stats by parsing the logfiles.

To run tests:

`docker-compose run web python manage.py test`


TODO:
- Allow only https requests, to prevent interception of sensitive information.
- Use robust stats libraries
- Allow a user to submit the keys they would like back in the resoponse. Perhaps validity is the only thing that matters for some users.
